perlpatch2svn v0.3
==================

A program to import bleadperl patches into a Subversion repository.

To install it, the usual mantra works, but it's perhaps simpler
to directly copy the perlpatch2svn script to the appropriate location.
If you want to make it executable, please check the shebang line as well.

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
under the same terms as Perl itself.
